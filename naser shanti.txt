what i understand from a subject 
___________________________________

iris flower dataset


we want to build a model that spacifey between 3 different type of flowers and these flowers called iris flowers
and we must have a dataset about it 
and a type of flower : -  (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica)

each flower must have a feature that specify it 

1 petal length ( ÿÊ· «·‰» … )
2 petal width (⁄—÷ «·‰» … )
3 sepal length 
4 sepal width 

the object ( aim ) is the make the machine able to spacify between this flower according to that features 


Sepals make food and protect reproductive parts of a flower 

while petals are coloured to attract insects for pollination


-----------

Now after we make a model find a Realtionship between 2 features  ,, we want to traning a Model to make arelationship between a dataset who does not seen 
(supervised learning)
